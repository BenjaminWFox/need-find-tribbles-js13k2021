10,048 tribbles are spread throughout the universe.

Today, nearing the end of the Great Tribble Hunt, only a few of the most unique and well disguised tribbles remain.

Find them quickly, before they start to multiply again!

The last time we left them alone the Universe was almost overrun...

The Tribbles:

All tribbles are one-of-a-kind NFTs!

If you find one before anyone else it's yours to keep!.

The tribbles live on the NEAR TestNet, so in order to play and collect you'll need an account. It's quick and free to sign up: https://wallet.testnet.near.org/

You can browse the tribble collection at: https://benjaminwfox.com/lab/js13k/2021/need-find-tribbles-browser

The Game:

Click around the star map to hunt for tribbles!

In addition to the tribbles, you may also encounter tribble gear (this is stored locally).

On the "Tribble Gear" tab you can dress up your stuffed tribble! Create your own unique looks, export the image, and create you own NFTs on any NFT platform!

As you explore the universe, you'll also encounter other interesting people and sights!
